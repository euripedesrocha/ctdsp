# ctdsp - A C++20 compile time DSP library

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/lefticus/cpp_starter_project/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/lefticus/cpp_starter_project)

## Why this library?

The main goal of this library is for me to study C++ generic and constexpr techniques in C++20. 

The secondary goal is to provide a set of functions to apply DSP techniques on many applications(That still need to think about :) )

# What this library provides:

 - [ ] Window generator for common functions
   - [ ] Boxcar generator
   - [ ] Bartlett generator
   - [ ] Gaussian generator
   - [ ] Example for user provided generator
 - [ ] constexpr time domain convolution
 - [ ] constexpr fft function
 - [ ] constexpr fast convolution 
 - [ ] 2d version of some operations.
