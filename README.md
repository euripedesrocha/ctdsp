## Why this library?

The main goal of this library is for me to study C++ generic and constexpr techniques in C++20. 
The secondary goal is to provide a set of functions to apply DSP techniques on many applications(That still need to think about :) )

# What this library provide :

 [ ] - Window generator for common functions
